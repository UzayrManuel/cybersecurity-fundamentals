# üß± The Hacker Methodology

---

## üîç Information Gathering

This stage involves collecting as much **publicly accessible information** about a target or organization as possible ‚Äî for example, OSINT and passive research.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This does *not* involve scanning any systems.

---

## üß≠ Enumeration / Scanning

This stage involves discovering **applications and services** running on the systems.  
Example: Finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

---

## üí• Exploitation

This stage involves **leveraging vulnerabilities** discovered on a system or application.

- Can involve using **public exploits**
- Or exploiting **application logic flaws**

---

## üîì Privilege Escalation

Once you‚Äôve successfully exploited a system (gained a **foothold**), this stage aims to **expand your access**:

- **Horizontal Escalation:** Accessing another account with the same level of privileges (e.g., another user)
- **Vertical Escalation:** Accessing a higher-privileged account (e.g., admin/root)

---

## üßπ Post-Exploitation

This stage includes several key sub-tasks:

1. **Pivoting:** Discovering what other internal hosts can be targeted
2. **Host Recon:** Gathering more information now that you‚Äôre a privileged user
3. **Covering Tracks:** Removing logs or evidence of the intrusion
4. **Reporting:** Documenting everything found, done, and recommended

## ‚úÖ Summary

These stages represent a structured approach to ethical hacking, CTFs, and penetration testing. Mastery of each step is essential for both real-world and lab environments.
